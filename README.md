# Enzyme activity predictions for dark clusters

![screenshot.png](screenshot.png)

Web app visualising enzymatic activity-associated features (pockets, DeepFRI GO/EC results) on a subset of clusters derived from the [AlphaFold Protein Structure Database](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk).

An instance is currently accessible on the [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://jurgjn-af-protein-universe-app-mss2ap.streamlit.app/).
